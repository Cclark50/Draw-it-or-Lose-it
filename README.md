# Draw-it-or-Lose-it

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Draw-it-or-Lose-it is a game that is designed to be played on both mobile and desktop platforms. 

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this assignment, I feel like I had the most success with describing the strengths and weaknesses of each operating system. Being able to detarmine which platforms are suited to which use is crucial, and was what I was most confident about.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Knowing which platform I was targeting when writing the code helped a lot. Additionally, knowing the purpose of the code I was writing also helped when determining how to go about some problems when solving them.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could, I would revise the description of the code I had written, as I do not feel I went into enough depth.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Since the client wanted a game that could run on any major consumer platform, we have to take that into account in the design process. If we just design software without taking needs into account, we wont be able to future proof for other operating systems and other needs the client wants. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I like to go from a bottom up approach. I like to think about what the client wants, and start from the smallest program I can think of and slowly work my way up to a more complete program. In the design stage, we must take in all the client's needs, then contruct software appropriate for them. Starting with the most necessary and wanted item of the software, and adding the other requirements one by one, integrating them the best as we possibly can.
